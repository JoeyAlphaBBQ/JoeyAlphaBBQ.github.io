Guess the Number Game

You will implement a "Guess the Number" game where the computer selects a random number within a range and the user has to guess it. HTML will form the structure for user input and feedback messages, CSS will make the game visually engaging, and JavaScript will handle the game logic like generating the random number and evaluating user guesses. Additional functionalities may include a hint system or a score tracker based on the number of attempts.
